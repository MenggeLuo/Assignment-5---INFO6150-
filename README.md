# Project Title: Movie Finder Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to:
- Register and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.
- Search for movies using various criteria such as keywords, dates, and locations.
- Access a personalized `Home` page after successful login.
- Recover their accounts via a password recovery system (in development).

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using email and password.
- **JWT Authorization**: Only authenticated users can access protected routes (e.g., `Home` page).
- **Captcha Verification**: Prevent automated requests during signup.
- **Movie Search**: Search functionality with criteria like keyword, date, and location.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Scalable Backend**: Backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
